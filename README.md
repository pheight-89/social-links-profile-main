## Overview

The primary goal is to accurately replicate a provided design for a card displaying a user's profile picture, name, location, a brief tagline, and a list of social media links. The challenge emphasizes responsive design, ensuring the card looks good on various screen sizes.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

First step was to break down the design in a way that was manageable. I determined grid would work well for this design as it was all in one column, with even spacing between the buttons. The name of the individual seems like the main heading to me with the location as a subheading. Then I noted that the links to different social media platforms appeared to be styled as a button. After taking note I wrote the HTML semantically and then stylised it to match the design.

### Built with
